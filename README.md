# Unveiling Vegetation Carbon Losses from Global Utility-Scale Solar Photovoltaic Expansion

This is only for visualizing the results


## step 1
Go to the website: https://romawhite90325.users.earthengine.app/view/solarpv

## step 2
Choose image to be display, default image is yearly NIRv

## step 3
Select ground-mounted utility-scale solar pv (PV_{GU}) station to view details.

All PV_{GU}s are filtered based on the identifier of "group id".

There is two ways to select PV_{GU}. You can select the targeted PV_{GU} based on its properties. 
For example, if you want to view the largest PV_{GU} in China, you can choose the "All types" for Land cover, "China" for Nation, "area" for sorted by, and then the first id in 'Group id' field is what you want.

Or, you can view the map and click the polygon of targeted PV_{GU}.

## step 4
View the details on the carbon cost
You can view the basic info, such as land cover, area, nation, etc., and differences in NIRv between solar land and buffer zones.
Also you can view the NPP loss, biomass loss and other info related to carbon.

## step 5
View the monthly NIRv
